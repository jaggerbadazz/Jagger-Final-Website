                <p>
                My name is Jagger Badazz, I'm a very passionate 19 year old creator working towards becoming a Showrunner / Creative Producer. This September, I will be returning to Calarts for my second year studying Character Animation. I am currently interning at Six Point Harness animation studios and was previously working at Home Plate Entertainment under Bill Schultz. From illustrating children's books,  to making iOS apps with my friends, I have a wide array of experience. My favorite traditional and digital mediums are ink and Adobe Photoshop. When i'm not drawing or reading scripts until 4 a.m. I enjoy playing soccer and spending time with my friends.

                <h2>Tony:</h2>
                <p>
                 Michael Sarah-esque.  At 21, Tony’s technically an adult but still doesn't know how to act like one. He’s got big dreams and high hopes - but he’s just not sure how he’s supposed to get there. I mean, how’s someone supposed to figure out how to navigate the entertainment industry if they still haven’t even figured themselves out? Sure he’s an emotional mess of hormones, built up stress, and anxiety on the inside but that’s just part of being 21… isn’t it? The constantly smiling young writer doesn’t have any real family of his own so he relies heavily on the people that he chooses to surround himself with.Tony’s optimistic, upbeat, and willing to try anything that get’s him closer to “making it”.

                <h2>8 Ball:</h2>
                <p>
                 Barry White-esque Ya know when someone says they have “a guy” or that they “now someone who knows someone who knows someone”? That “someone” is a 4 foot tall talking racoon named 8-Ball. He's the guy with all the answers and all of the connections. While he doesn't have an overbearing or dominant presence, his smooth deep voice is what gives him an edge. You need a pallet of unmarked bills in low increments? Desperately searching for an orange rhinoceros fluent in mandarin? Or maybe you’re just looking for a smooth talking wingman? 8-Ball’s your guy.
                </p>
                <p>(Relationship) He's Tony's best friend and also happens to be his roommate.</p>

            <div class="bio">
                <h2>Big J:</h2>
                <p>
                 Joey Diaz-esque Big J is a schmoozing older man in his late 40's with a heavy New Jersey Tough Guy accent. He knows this town forwards and backwards - and everyone in it. Jay wants to make Tony's career a success (and take 10% of it). He always recalls back to the good days - translation, the time where he was the “top agent in Hollywood”. And although he brings this up quite often, only a couple people ever seem to remember it… He’s got an unmatched hustle and enough gaudy fake jewelry to put a Kardashian to shame. But most importantly, he’s taken Tony under his wing and acts almost like a father to the young boy. While the hustle and fame of showbiz may elude Jay, he always looks out for Tony’s best interests.
